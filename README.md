#FIR Filter Design for Given Specifications

This project is undertaken with the objective of demonstrating the design process of a digital filter using the windowing method in conjunction with the Kaiser window to fit given requirements. The filter is then analyzed and verified. A comprehensive summery of the basic principles of filter design also have been revised as a part of this project report. Mathematical analysis has been carried out using Matlab 2014a software. It is submitted as the semester project for the module 'Digital Signal Processing'.

Objectives

1. To test the conceptual understanding of Fourier series methods of designing FIR Filters
2. To provide experience in designing a FIR Filter to fit the given specifications
